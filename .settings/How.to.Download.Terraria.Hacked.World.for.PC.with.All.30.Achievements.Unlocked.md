A hacked world is a modified version of the game's world file that contains items, structures, and settings that are not normally available in the vanilla game. For example, a hacked world may have chests full of rare items, NPCs that sell everything you need, or bosses that are already defeated. A hacked world can also unlock all 30 achievements for you, which are normally earned by completing various tasks and challenges in the game.
 
If you want to download a terraria hacked world for PC with all 30 achievements unlocked, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Backup your original world file. You can find it in `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds`. Copy and paste it somewhere safe in case you want to restore it later.
2. Download a hacked world file from a trusted source. There are many websites and forums that offer hacked worlds for terraria, but be careful of malware and viruses. One of the most popular and reliable sources is [Terraria Hacked Worlds](https://terraria.curseforge.com/projects/terraria-hacked-worlds), which has over 100 different worlds to choose from.
3. Extract the downloaded file and copy the .wld file to your worlds folder. You can use any file extractor program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to open the compressed file. Then, copy the .wld file to `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds`.
4. Launch Terraria and select the hacked world from the menu. You should see the name of the hacked world in the list of available worlds. Click on it and start playing.
5. Enjoy your hacked world with all 30 achievements unlocked. You can check your achievements by pressing `Esc` and clicking on the trophy icon. You should see all 30 achievements marked as completed.

That's it! You have successfully downloaded a terraria hacked world for PC with all 30 achievements unlocked. Have fun exploring, building, and fighting in your new world. Just remember to backup your original world file if you want to switch back to it later.
  
If you want to try out different hacked worlds for terraria, you can download more from the same source or look for other websites and forums that offer them. However, be careful of downloading files from unknown or untrusted sources, as they may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer. Always scan the files with an antivirus program before opening them.
 
Another thing to keep in mind is that hacked worlds may not be compatible with the latest version of terraria or with other mods that you have installed. Some hacked worlds may require a specific version of the game or a certain mod to work properly. If you encounter any problems or errors while playing a hacked world, try updating your game or disabling your mods. Alternatively, you can delete the hacked world file and restore your original one.
 
Hacked worlds are a fun and easy way to enjoy terraria with all the achievements unlocked and without the hassle of grinding and farming. They can also give you access to items, structures, and settings that are not normally available in the vanilla game. However, they are not meant to replace the original game experience, but rather to enhance it. If you want to play terraria the way it was intended, you should stick to your original world file and earn the achievements by yourself.
